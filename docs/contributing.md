# Contributing to Lenscove

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to **Lenscove** ❤️  
All contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome.

This document explains how to contribute in a smooth and predictable way.

## 📌 Project Workflow

Lenscove follows a simple branching strategy:

- `main` — production-ready code (released versions)
- `develop` — active development branch
- `feature/*` — feature or improvement branches

Direct pushes to `main` and `develop` are disabled.

All changes **must go through a Pull Request**.

---

## 🛠 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run the test suite locally
5. Open a Pull Request **against `develop`**

Please keep pull requests focused and small when possible.

---

## ✅ Pull Request Requirements

Before a PR can be merged:

- All automated checks must pass
- The branch must be up to date with `develop`
- All PR conversations must be resolved

Pull requests are reviewed and merged at the maintainer’s discretion.

---

## 🧪 Tests

If your contribution affects logic or behavior, please include tests.

The CI pipeline will automatically run tests for every pull request.

---

## 🐛 Issues & Feature Requests

- Use **Issues** for bugs, questions, or feature proposals
- Provide as much context as possible (steps to reproduce, screenshots, logs)

---

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in discussions.  
Harassment or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## 💬 Questions?

If you’re unsure about anything, feel free to open an issue or discussion.

Thanks again for helping improve Lenscove 🚀
